Curses-Menu Gherkin Tests

These feature files cannot be run due to issues with behave and Python 3.6.0+.
Python 3.5.3 works with behave, but does not allow you to install curses on Windows.
Python 3.5.2 works with behave and curses for Windows 10. Windows 7 has problems with installing curses for Python 3.5.X.
We have not tested Linux or Mac OSX.

Please use Python 3.5.2 on Windows 10.
