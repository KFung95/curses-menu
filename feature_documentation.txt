Curses-Menu Gherkin Tests

These feature files cannot be run due to issues with behave 1.2.5 and Python 3.6.0+.
We have not tested Linux or Mac OSX.

Python 3.6.1 works with behave 1.2.6.dev0 and curses.
Please use Python 3.6.1 with behave 1.2.6.dev0 for Windows.
Run behave from command line or terminal.
